# **Sudoku Game**
- ## Project Idea
A react project where I built a Sudoku game.

The focus point in my project is to give beginners an opportunity to learn Sudoku, as most of the applications available have an upper limit for mistakes that can be committed, which is 3. And I want to spread it among my friends and encourage them to learn it.
